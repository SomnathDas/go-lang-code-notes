	/*
		Since the rune type represents a Unicode character, a string in Go is often referred to as a sequence of runes.
		However, runes are stored as 1, 2, 3, or 4 bytes depending on the character.
		Due to this, strings are really just a sequence of bytes.
		In Go, slices are used to represent sequences and these slices can be iterated over using range.
